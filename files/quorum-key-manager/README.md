# Quorum Key Manager Quickstart

Quorum Key Manager (QKM) is a key management service that exposes an HTTP API service to manage your secrets, keys and Ethereum accounts. QKM supports the integration with
*AWS Key Management Service*, *Azure Key Vault* and *HashiCorp Vault*.

In addition, using the JSON-RPC interface of the QKM, you can connect to your Ethereum nodes to sign your transaction using the Ethereum account stored in your secure key vault.

Quorum Key Manager is developed under the [BSL 1.1](LICENSE) license and written in Go.

For more information, refer to the Quorum Key Manager official [Documentation](https://docs.quorum-key-manager.consensys.net/).


| ⚠️ **Note**: If you have an existing Quorum quickstart running, please stop it before proceeding. The Orchestrate quickstart spins up an Ethereum client which serves as an RPC endpoint. If you have an existing RPC endpoint, please update the `NETWORK_ENDPOINT` in the `.env` file and comment out the eth_client container in the file `<output_folder>/orchestrate/scripts/deps/docker-compose.yml` |

## Environment setup

**Start service dependencies**

We start Postgres and Hashicorp Vault service as part of Quorum Key Manager dependencies:
```bash
$> docker compose -f docker-compose.deps.yml up -d
```

**Start selected network**

We start the selected network (GoQuorum|Besu):
```bash
$> cd ./network
$> ./run.sh
...
```

Then we go back to root folder
```bash
$> cd ...
```


To see more option information about the running underline network, see [README.md](./network/README.md)

**Start Quorum Key Manager:**

Once dependencies and network are running we can start Quorum Key Manager service:
```
$> docker compose up -d
```


## HTTP-API

Quorum Key Manager is exposing a HTTP API which it is documented in [https://consensys.github.io/quorum-key-manager](https://consensys.github.io/quorum-key-manager)
